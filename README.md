The 5-fold cross-validation confirms the high performance of both models. The Optimal Decision Tree shows a perfect mean accuracy of 1.0000 with zero variance, while the Random Forest is close behind at 0.9971. This extremely high performance suggests the dataset is either very clean, highly separable, or potentially suffers from data leakage, but based on the metrics alone, the optimized Decision Tree demonstrates the best generalization ability according to this evaluation.
